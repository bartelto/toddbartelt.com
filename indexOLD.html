        <h2>About Todd</h2>
        <img class="headshot" src="assets/images/Todd-Bartelt.jpg" alt="Headshot of Todd Bartelt">

        <p>Todd may be a web developer in training, but he’s hardly new to coding. Todd first learned to code when he was in 5th grade after his science teacher gave him a book about Apple BASIC. Todd eagerly ate up the material, and started writing his own programs after school while waiting for his mom (a fourth-grade teacher) to finish up each day.</p>

        <p>But a career in programming was not at all an obvious choice back then, and because Todd had a talent for math and science, he ended up pursuing a more-conventional career in mechanical engineering. Like programming, engineering fed his desire to create cool stuff and to solve problems. But ironically, while Todd was pursuing his master’s degree in mechanical engineering, the project he was most excited about? A website he built in his spare time to share about the growth of his 20-pound rubber band ball.</p>
        
        <p>Now, after a decade of meandering in his career, Todd is finally returning to web development — and this time, he’s serious. He’s learning a lot at the University of Kansas’ Coding Boot Camp, but it’s hard work, so please use the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page to encourage him!</p>
